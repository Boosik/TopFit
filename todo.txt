To Do / Wishlist

Options:
- automatically equip generated set
- save as equipment set (needs to be equipped)

- always match socket colors
- special weapon types (dagger in main hand for certain rogues)


Tooltip:
- show user-added stat for procs etc


Functionality:
- Importing of Pawn Strings as equipment sets
- Prevent set name conflicts (automatically rename xxx to 2-xxx or something like that)
- Antispam for warnings, so they can be implemented for gems and enchants
- seperate stats for main-, offhand and ranged weapon dps
- ability to comment set (for player's referece)
- Stat synonym model (so all variations of mana regen are handled the same way)
- ability to make copies of set (as backup or for slight adjustment)
- what to do if a forced item is no longer in the player's inventory?
- check if items from a set are missing
- better caching (itemListBySlot with static information, calculated scores etc. in another table)
