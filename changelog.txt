3.3v2 - 2010/03/13

- calculations frame can now be closed by pressing the ESC key
- added predefined sets from WoWHead (with very slight scores for armor and dps, so  you can even use it starting at level 1)
- fixed bug where statlist in progress frame would not show correctly if you had no item with a chosen stat
