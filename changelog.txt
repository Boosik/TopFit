Changelog for TopFit
====================

3.3v3
  - fixed bug where a new item would not be equipped if you already had an item with the same item-ID equipped e.g. [xxx of the Whale] and [xxx of the Bandit]
  - fixed bug with detecting BoE-items and accidentally trying to equip them if you had no other options for that slot
  - fixed a bug where fishing poles were considered One-Handed for Titan's Grip
  - rewrote calculation function for easier maintenance. This should also fix the swap-bug and any problems with invalid main- / offhand combinations
  - major options overhaul - set weights, forced items, etc. are now set in the calculations frame (expand the options by clicking the button labeled ">>")
  - added a button to the character frame which lets you open the calculations frame
  - added a button to the calculations frame which opens the addon's options
  - the calculations frame will now show wether caps have been reached or not
  - support for set pieces
  - added slash commands (/tf show, /tf options)
  - removed profiles from options (there should be no real need for those)

3.3v2 - 2010/03/13
  - calculations frame can now be closed by pressing the ESC key
  - Binds-on-Equip-Items will no longer be included in set calculations - bind the item first if you intend to use it
  - added predefined sets from WoWHead (with very slight scores for armor and dps, so you can even use it starting at level 1)
  - added option to choose a set that will be updated whenever you get new equipment (will not show calculation frame or any output, designed for carefree questing)
  - fixed bug where statlist in progress frame would not show correctly if you had no item with a chosen stat
  - fixed bug when determining wether a weapon can be used for Titan's Grip
